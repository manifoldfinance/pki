# Security Policy

This document outlines the Responsible Disclosure Program for Manifold Finance's open source software.

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

At Manifold Finance we take security seriously and consider it a top priority. Since a
public disclosure of a security vulnerability could put the entire Manifold Finance
community at risk, we require that potential vulnerabilities are kept
confidential until they are confirmed and fixed. We appreciate your efforts in
keeping Manifold Finance and its users safe by responsibly disclosing any security
vulnerability. 

Rest assured we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Any security related issue should be reported to Manifold Finance via the form at the
bottom of the [Responsible Disclosure Policy
page](https://manifoldfinance.com/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

If individuals prefer to directly communicate with the Manifold Finance security team,
they are invited to send an email to security@manifoldfinance.com

For encrypted communication, you can download our PGP key from our [PKI Repository](https://github.com/manifoldfinance/pki)
